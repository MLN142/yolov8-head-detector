# YOLOv8 Head Detector (Trained on JHU-CROWD++)

This repository provides a YOLOv8 model trained to detect **human heads in dense crowd scenes**. The model was trained using the [JHU-CROWD++](http://www.crowd-counting.com) dataset and can be used for research in areas such as crowd counting, surveillance, and crowd safety systems.

> ⚠️ This repository only contains the trained model and inference scripts. The full stampede detection or crowd analysis pipeline is **not** included.
